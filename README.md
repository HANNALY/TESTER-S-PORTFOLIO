# My Tester's Portfolio

Hi there 👋 I'm Anna.

I am a Software Tester with over a year of experience in manual testing, currently expanding my expertise toward test automation. I began my QA journey at Mate Academy, where I built strong fundamentals in manual testing and Java. Today, I am developing my skills further in a corporate environment as a QA Intern at Play.

On a daily basis, I create test cases, plan tests, and report bugs while working in an Agile environment using tools such as JIRA and Confluence. I focus strongly on quality, effective team communication, and continuous technical growth.

I also have experience working with relational databases and SQL (SQL Server Management Studio), which I gained during my Big Data Management studies. My goal is to continue developing in the areas of test automation and data analysis.

In this portfolio, you will find examples of my work, including test cases and bug reports that reflect the knowledge and experience I have gained so far.

In my free time, I enjoy spending time with my family, playing the guitar, traveling, and watching films.
